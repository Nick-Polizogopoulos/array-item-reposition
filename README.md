# array-item-reposition
A simple algorithm for repositioning an element in an array in TypeScript.<br>
In the first call the first element moves three times to the right.<br> 
In the second call the fourth element moves once to the left.<br>
With the exact calls, this prints: [ 2, 3, 4, 1, 5 ]  -  [ 1, 2, 4, 3, 5 ].<br> 
Items can't jump out of the array. - Thank you!
