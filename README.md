# array-item-reposition
A simple algorithm for repositioning an element in an array in TypeScript. In the first call the first element moves three times to the right. In the second call the fourth element moves once to the left. With the exact calls, this prints: [ 2, 3, 4, 1, 5 ]  -  [ 1, 2, 4, 3, 5 ]. Items can't jump out of the array. - Thank you!
